```
Nights like these
There's something mystical about nights like these
And the concept of time don't matter
Thoughts in my mind fill my eyes with water, oh-oh
I try to talk to God
And I close my eyes but I don't see anyone
I still pray for forgiveness every time I sit
So don't need my fate in the hands of my enemies (yeah, yeah)
Don't let me down, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't let me drown, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't let me down, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't let me drown
Don't let me down
Nowadays
Now I'm just too famous, I no fit to hide my face
They call me Odogwu 'cause I live up to my name
Abura abura kai le
Tell me who you go call?
When it feel like you no get nobody at all
I still play the blame game with the man in the mirror
Don't you leave me on my own now
Don't let me down, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't let me drown, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't let me down, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't let me drown
Don't let me down
Don't let me drown
Don't let me down
I try to talk to God
And I close my eyes but I don't see anyone
